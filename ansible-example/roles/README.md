# Ansible roles

Try to use public (validated) roles as much as possible. Do not build custom roles
unless absolutely required.

Custom roles for a specific project must be prefixed by the project name. 
E.g: `project1-deploy`

Refer to the `.gitignore` for more details.

All other roles in this folder will (and should) be ignored.
